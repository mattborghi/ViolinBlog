In order to improve and see \n                  real changes, you need to practice frequently and have patience.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The main idea of writing this blog was to inspire myself and others (mainly adults like me)\n                  to keep improving or start learning this fantastic instrument. Watching yourself improve along the years\n                  is the best way to keep you motivated. Also I starting recording myself regularly \n                  during the pandemics, around June 2020, in order to show my professor the advances during the week.\n                  For that reason, I thought that it would be a good idea to share my experiences with others.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  When I was around 20 years old, I tried learning violin by myself without previous music background \n                  but I failed miserably. Since I was studying in uni, I didn't have much time\n                  and I didn't feel motivated enough.\n                  So, after finishing my university studies I started taking classes with a professor \n                  (at the <a href=\"https://ecmusica.com.ar/\" title=\"ECM\">Creative Music School</a> in Vicente Lopez, Buenos Aires, Argentina on July 2018 at 27 years old) \n                  and I think it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. \n                  Although there are some times that it is difficult to have a couple of minutes to practice or even the motivation\n                  as I said before, watching the improvements over time made me enjoy more the tedious technique practice sessions\n                  even if I wanted to go to sleep or make something else.  \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Finally, if you feel like writing to me, just do it! I will answer you as soon as I can. \n                  Anyways, try to make the same as I do to see how much you have progressed since you started learning. You will be surely surprised!\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </PostFullContent>\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </Wrapper>\n  </IndexLayout>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
