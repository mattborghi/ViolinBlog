Here it's presented the first attempt at playing both pieces at 80bpm. 

There are clear mistakes, but I am also trying to correct the right hand grip. Right now I am grabing the bow more like in the **Russian** method (*right side of image*), but I am trying to do it like the **Franco-Belgian** one (*left side of image*).
