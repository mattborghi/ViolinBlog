In order to improve and see \n                  real changes you need to practice constantly and with patience.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  So the main idea of writing this blog is to inspire myself and others (mainly adults like me)\n                  to keep improving or start learning this fantastic instrument.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I try self-taught violin when I was around 20 years old but I was studying at uni, I didn't have much time\n                  and I didn't feel motivated enough (I had no prior musical knowledge).\n                  So, after finishing my univeristy studies I start going to classes with a professor and I think it was one of \n                  the best decisions I have ever made. \n                  Although there are some times that it is difficult to have a couple of minutes to practice or even the motivation\n                  as I said before, watching the improvements over time made me enjoy more the tedious technique practice sessions\n                  even if I wanted to go to sleep or make something else.  \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Finally, if you feel like writing me do it!
