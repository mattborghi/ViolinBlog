In order to improve and see \n                  real changes, you need to practice frequently and have patience.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The main idea of writing this blog is to inspire myself and others (mainly adults like me)\n                  to keep improving or start learning this fantastic instrument.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I self-taught violin when I was around 20 years old but I was studying at uni but I failed. I didn't have much time\n                  and I didn't feel motivated enough (I had no prior musical knowledge).\n                  So, after finishing my university studies I started going to classes with a professor \n                  (at the <a href=\"https://ecmusica.com.ar/\" title=\"ECM\">Creative Music School</a> in Vicente Lopez, Buenos Aires, Argentina on July 2018 at 27 years old) \n                  and I think it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. \n                  Although there are some times that it is difficult to have a couple of minutes to practice or even the motivation\n                  as I said before, watching the improvements over time made me enjoy more the tedious technique practice sessions\n                  even if I wanted to go to sleep or make something else.  \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Finally, if you feel like writing me, just do it! I will answer you as soon as I can and try to make the same as I do to \n                  see how much you have progressed since you started learning.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </PostFullContent>\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </Wrapper>\n  </IndexLayout>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
